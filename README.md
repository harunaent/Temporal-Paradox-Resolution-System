# Decentralized Autonomous Temporal Paradox Resolution System (DATPRS)

## Overview
DATPRS is a theoretical blockchain-based platform for simulating and analyzing temporal paradoxes through distributed computing and consensus mechanisms.

## Core Components

### Smart Contract Engine
- Paradox Definition Protocol (PDP) for encoding temporal scenarios
- Resolution Attempt Registry (RAR) for tracking proposed solutions
- Time-Consistency Validator (TCV) for checking logical coherence
- Causal Chain Monitor (CCM) for tracking butterfly effects

### Computation Layer
- Distributed simulation nodes for parallel universe modeling
- Resource allocation through proof-of-computation
- Dynamic scaling based on paradox complexity
- Quantum state preservation for maintaining timeline consistency

### Consensus Mechanism
- Peer review staking system
- Reputation-weighted voting on resolution validity
- Slashing conditions for invalid proofs
- Multi-signature requirements for scenario validation

### Token Economics
- PARA utility token for computation resources
- Resolution staking and rewards
- Validator incentive structure
- Anti-spam mechanisms

### NFT Framework
- ERC-721 tokens representing verified paradox scenarios
- Metadata standard for temporal properties
- Transferable resolution proofs
- Historical significance scoring

## Technical Requirements
- EVM-compatible blockchain
- IPFS for scenario storage
- Zero-knowledge proofs for private simulations
- WebAssembly runtime for client-side verification

## Security Considerations
- Timeline integrity protection
- Sybil attack prevention
- Formal verification of critical contracts
- Temporal oracle attack mitigation

## Development Roadmap
1. Core protocol specification
2. Smart contract development
3. Simulation engine prototype
4. Testnet deployment
5. Security audits
6. Mainnet launch

## Governance
- DAO structure for protocol upgrades
- Community-driven paradox validation
- Research grant distribution
- Resolution dispute arbitration

## Integration Guide
```solidity
interface IParadoxRegistry {
    function submitParadox(
        bytes32 timelineHash,
        uint256 complexity,
        address resolver
    ) external returns (uint256 paradoxId);
    
    function proposeResolution(
        uint256 paradoxId,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external returns (bool);
}
```
